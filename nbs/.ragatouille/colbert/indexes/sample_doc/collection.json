  "Abstract: The of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to cause DNA damage in infected humans requires its study as a potential indicator of COVID-19 progression. DNA damage was studied in leukocytes of 65 COVID-19 patients stratified by sex, age, and disease severity in relation to demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters. In combined group of COVID-19 patients, DNA damage was shown to be elevated compared to controls (12.44% vs. 5.09%, p < 0.05). Severe cases showed higher DNA damage than moderate cases (14.66% vs. 10.65%, p < 0.05) , and males displayed more damage than females (13.45% vs. 8.15%, p < 0.05). DNA damage is also correlated with international normalized ratio (INR) (r = 0.471, p < 0.001) and creatinine (r = 0.326, p < 0.05).",

In addition to DNA damage, severe COVID-19 is associated with age, C-reactive protein (CRP) , and creatinine Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified age, INR, creatinine, DNA damage, and CRP as significant predictors of disease severity, with cut-off values of 72.50 years , 1.46 s, 78.0 umol/L, 9.72%, and 50.0 mg/L, respectively. The results show that DNA damage correlates with commonly accepted COVID-19 risk factors. These findings underscore the potential of DNA damage as a biomarker for COVID-19 severity, suggesting its inclusion in prognostic assessments to facilitate early intervention and improve patient outcomes. ability",

  "The global Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has had a huge impact; with more than 775 million cases and over 7 million deaths reported worldwide as of 14 July 2024 [1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared an end to the COVID-19 global health emergency on 5 May 2023 [2_4]. However, SARS-CoV-2 still poses a global threat due to the development of new viral variants that might escape immunity [5] According to the COVID-19 epidemiological as of 17 June 2024, WHO is currently tracking several SARS-CoV-2 variants: three variants of interest: EG.5 (nickname Eris , descendant of Omicron) , BA.2.86, and JN.1; and four variants under monitoring: JN.1.7, JN.1.18, KP2, and KP3 [6]: One of the currently circulating Omicron subvariants , EG.5, has exhibited an increased effective reproductive rate, prompting concerns about its contagiousness and immune evasion capabilities [7]. update",

  "COVID-19 is characterized by an unpredictable and extremely variable disease course ranging from asymptomatic cases to severe illness. Until now, significant gaps remain in our knowledge about the causes of mild, moderate, or severe clinical courses , as well as the long-term consequences of this disease. The broad spectrum of clinical manifestations of COVID-19 requires the search for the identification of predictive molecular markers , which currently mainly focus on clinical and laboratory parameters.",
  "DNA damage studies were performed in COVID-19 patients in different tissues like blood [13-17], [18] and cardiac [19] tissue samples (including such from fatal COVID 19 cases [18]), as well as lung of SARS-CoV-2-infected hACE2-mouse [12]. There are studies both with [14,17] and without [13,15,16] stratifying the studied patients according to the severity of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2-induced DNA damage was also analyzed in infected cell lines [12,20,21]. lung",
  "According to Grand [8], until recently, the relationship between the virus and human genome stability; as well as the DNA damage response (DDR), were poorly studied. However, it is now evident that SARS-CoV-2 damages host cell DNA and intricately interacts DDR [10-12]",
  "The effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the host genome were analyzed with alkaline [12-15,17,22] or neutral [16] versions of the comet assay using Tail DNA (%) [13-15,17,22], Tail Moment, and Olive Tail Moment [12] as endpoints. DNA damage has also been studied micronucleus tests [21,22], YHZAX (marker of double-strand break (DSB)) and pRPAS4 /8 (marker of SSB) foci [12,18-20]. using",
  "Summarizing the available publications on DNA damage in COVID-19 Grand [8]notes that \"Because almost all the information discussed here has been published recently and may be preliminary in a few instances  in some cases there are inconsistencies and divergent views, which will need further evaluation for verification in the future; however; it is hoped that the case has been made that the DDR is an important target for SARS-CoV-2\" -",
  "Despite ongoing research, there are still significant gaps in our understanding of the relationship between disease progression and genetic markers.  One reason for this is the wide variation in the designs of the studies, which makes it difficult to interpret them together:",
  "It is known that DNA damage and impaired repair mechanisms foster genome instability and are involved in several chronic diseases. One possible consequence of DNA damage in COVID-19 patients may be cardiac problems [19]- In addition; SARS-CoV-2 proteins can elevate genomic instability and pose potential oncogenic activity via degradation of the co-suppressors retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and p53 [23].",

However; available prognostic markers to predict potential disease complications are needed to enable earlier intervention and combat future pandemics. Despite numerous studies, prognostic biomarkers for the severity and complications of COVID-19 disease remain poorly understood. The available studies are extremely heterogeneous due to differences in COVID-19 symptoms and severity; sample size, methods used, and a number of other reasons, so interest in this topic remains high. Current studies of predictive biomarkers for COVID-19 have mainly focused on clinical and laboratory parameters [25], with much less attention to DNA damage in infected individuals. paid",
  "Therefore, the main aspect of our study was to analyze DNA damage in infected patients together with demographic and laboratory parameters and to define the biological markers that are useful in predicting a severe disease course in COVID-19 patients. The patients selected for our study were hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19; none were admitted to intensive care, and all eventually recovered after treatment. In addition, the patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 did not differ in terms of comorbidities , which are a major factor in COVID-19 complications. Patients were stratified according to sex and age, which are known risk factors for the severity of COVID-19 [26,27]. The current",

  "DNA damage was significantly higher in males than in females in a moderate group of patients. Existing studies of DNA damage do not stratify COVID-19 patients by sex, but our data are consistent with studies indicating that; at all ages, males appear to have a higher likelihood of progressing to severe COVID-19 than females [29]. Sex-based behavior; genetic and hormonal factors, and sex differences in biological pathways associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection are considered as possible causes [30]. Moreover; it was suggested that androgens are positive regulators of TMPRSS2, which is a regulator of SARS-CoV-2 entry [31] No significant differences were found in the level of DNA damage between adults and the elderly in both moderate and severe groups, possibly due to insufficient age differences to influence this parameter (62 (44.5-69.5) versus 72 (63.0-70.0) years).",
  "Previous studies using different techniques to measure DNA damage (comet assay and micronucleus test) have shown that high levels of genetic damage are more pronounced in COVID-19 patients [13,15,16,32], as well as in the severe group compared to the moderate group [14,17] Levels of DNA damage in the total group of patients as well as in subgroups stratified by COVID-19 severity were shown to be correlated with INR (coagulation biomarker) and creatinine (renal injury biomarker) in most cases. key",

  "The correlation of comets with creatinine was found to be unreliable in the group of patients studied by Mihaljevic et al. [13]. Although there are no other studies linking DNA damage and renal pathology in COVID-19 , there is evidence of increased genomic damage in lymphocytes from patients with uremia, identified by comet analysis [33]. Moreover; comet levels have been shown to be associated with chronic kidney disease in patients with elevated creatinine [34]. The authors link this to impaired DNA repair caused by the uremic state, as well as chronic inflammation associated with increased generation of reactive oxygen species [34]. There are also no studies linking DNA damage to INR, but Basaran et al. [14] showed correlation of comets with fibrinogen; another coagulation marker in COVID-19 patients.",

  "To date, a large body of literature has accumulated on the mechanisms of DNA damage in cells or organisms infected with a virus. These studies support the important role of DNA damage as a marker of coronavirus infection. Many RNA viruses can induce significant DNA damage in host cells, even when viral replication occurs exclusively in the cytoplasm, as in the case of SARS-CoV-2 [35,36]. DNA damage can contribute to the pathogenesis of RNA viruses [35].",
  "Besides DNA damage, SARS-CoV-2 was reported to affect two other aspects of the host genome: First, accelerated telomere shortening was found in infected Vero E6 cells [20] and COVID-19 survivors [38] Second, the virus genome [39] and vaccine mRNA [40] were reported to be reverse-transcribed and integrated into the host genome.

The non-parametric Spearman's correlation test was to assess the relationship between the parameters studied. A p-value 0.05 was considered statistically significant:. Inc., http: / used",
  "The obtained data highlight the potential significance of DNA damage as a biomarker in predicting the severity of COVID-19. Our analysis revealed that patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited higher levels of DNA damage compared to those with moderate disease, with male patients showing more pronounced damage than females. predictors of severity included age, CRP , creatinine, and INR, all correlating positively with DNA damage. ROC analysis further validated and identified specific cut-off values for the age (72.5 years)  INR (1.46 s), creatinine (78.0 umol/L) DNA damage (9.72%), and CRP (50.0 mg/L) as significant predictors of severe COVID-19 , highlighting their clinical relevance_ The cut-off points of the indicators studied are not valid in all subgroups strati fied by sex and age, and there are also minor differences in level between them, which is consistent with the importance of sex and age in the severity of infection and should be taken into account:. Thus, in the studied group of patients, the levels of DNA damage are well consistent with the severity of COVID-19.",
  "Thus, in the studied group of patients, the levels of DNA damage are well consistent with the severity of COVID-19. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that many of the laboratory parameters included in this study did not show any relation to the severity of the infection: Thus, the inclusion of DNA damage measurement in COVID-19 management protocols with clinical and laboratory indicators could improve prog nostic accuracy and patient care, which warrants further research to validate its utility across diverse populations and clinical settings.
