### Overview: Architecture of the Multi-Agent PDF RAG System

The system consists of two main stages:

1. **Ingestion Stage (Graph Building and Embedding Creation)**
2. **Query Stage (Intelligent RAG with Graph Traversal and Embedding Search)**

We'll leverage your existing Python-based multi-agent library to build this architecture.

---

## Stage 1: PDF Ingestion & Graph Building

This stage converts PDF contents into structured data and embeddings.

### Workflow:

1. **PDF Extraction (HTML → Markdown/Text)**
    - Use your existing library to parse PDFs into HTML (e.g., using `PyMuPDF`, `pdfplumber`, or `pdf2htmlEX`).
    - Convert HTML to Markdown or plain text (`markdownify` or custom parser).
    - Break the markdown into logical document chunks or sections (title, headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

2. **Textual and Visual Embeddings**
    - **Textual embeddings:** Use embedding models (e.g., OpenAI `text-embedding-3-large`, SentenceTransformers).
    - **Visual embeddings:** Optional (CLIP/DINO/OCR), beneficial for PDFs heavy in diagrams/tables.

3. **Graph Representation (Graph Agent Set)**
    - Create an agent specifically tasked with graph construction.
    - Identify and connect nodes based on document structure (headings, subheadings, sections).
    - Tag nodes with metadata: title, keywords, summaries, embedding references, page numbers, etc.
    - Agents incrementally traverse the parsed markdown and embed relationships, creating a semantic graph.

### Example Tools for Graph Agents:
- `create_node(node_content: str, metadata: dict)`
- `link_nodes(source_id: str, target_id: str, relation: str)`
- `update_node(node_id: str, new_content: str)`
- `search_node(keyword_embedding: np.array)`

## Stage 2: Intelligent RAG System (Query Stage)

This is a multi-agent collaborative loop:

- User queries come in.
- RAG agent crafts custom search strings (not simple keyword matching).
- Graph agent traverses the knowledge graph based on the crafted search.
- Embedding search agent retrieves relevant text chunks.

### Workflow:

1. **Query Crafting (RAG Agent)**
    - Analyze user's question and conversation context.
    - Formulate an optimal, tailored embedding query (natural-language embedding search) rather than basic keyword search.

2. **Graph Traversal (Graph Traversal Agent)**
    - Leverage the crafted query to traverse your previously built graph, identifying high-value nodes.
    - Explain traversal reasoning (anchors & visibility), maintaining explainability.

3. **Embedding Retrieval (Embedding Search Agent)**
    - Execute embedding similarity search using crafted embedding queries.
    - Retrieve top relevant chunks from embeddings database.

4. **Aggregation Agent**
    - Combines results from graph traversal and embedding retrieval.
    - Synthesizes a cohesive response, grounding each part explicitly (e.g., citation: "section X, node Y").

## Suggested Agent Roles & Toolsets

### Agent Types:
- **GraphBuilderAgent**: Builds and updates graph from PDF.
- **EmbeddingAgent**: Manages embeddings database, handles retrieval queries.
- **QueryCraftingAgent**: Crafts smart embedding-based search strings.
- **GraphTraversalAgent**: Traverses semantic graph based on queries.
- **AggregationAgent**: Combines graph and embedding results, forms final answers with explainability.

### Recommended Tool Calls:
```python
GraphBuilderAgent.tools = [
    create_node, link_nodes, update_node, search_node,
]

EmbeddingAgent.tools = [
    embed_chunk, search_embeddings,
]

QueryCraftingAgent.tools = [
    craft_embedding_query, analyze_chat_history,
]

GraphTraversalAgent.tools = [
    traverse_graph, explain_traversal_decision,
]

AggregationAgent.tools = [
    aggregate_answers, cite_sources,
]
```

## Implementation Roadmap (Incremental Steps)

### Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Parse PDF → markdown
- Simple text embeddings creation
- Basic semantic graph creation
- Simple RAG retrieval & basic graph traversal with direct query match.

### Phase 2: Intelligent Querying (Advanced RAG)
- Intelligent agent crafting custom embedding queries
- Advanced graph traversal algorithms with anchoring/explainability

### Phase 3: Full Multi-Agent System
- Integration of parallel workflows (embeddings and graph)
- Multi-agent tool loop: real-time collaboration and decision-making
- Full anchoring: Explainable, citable, and grounded responses

---

## Anchoring & Explainability

To ensure explainability:

- Each agent decision should return a trace (why traversal moved node-to-node, why specific embeddings were retrieved).
- Responses should always reference their graph paths and document chunks (e.g., "Node [X] related to [Y] because…").

---

## Synergy Between Embeddings and Graph

**Key synergy**:
- **Embeddings**: Efficiently identify similar or related content (fuzzy matching).
- **Graph**: Explicit semantic relationships, structured context, explainability.

For queries, agents should:

- First do broad retrieval with embeddings.
- Then refine contextually using graph traversal, combining embeddings' recall and graph traversal’s precision.

---

## Example Query & Agent Interaction Scenario:

> User: "What is the percentage increase in revenues according to this report?"

- **QueryCraftingAgent** crafts: `"percentage revenue growth year-over-year financial results"`
- **EmbeddingAgent** retrieves relevant embedding chunks.
- **GraphTraversalAgent** traverses from "Financial Results" → "Revenues" → "Year-over-Year Analysis" nodes.
- **AggregationAgent** combines both results, grounding explicitly with citations:
  - "According to [section 4.2 Financial Results], revenue increased by **12%** compared to last year ([pg. 24, node Financial Growth Analysis])."

---

## Technologies & Libraries (Recommended)

- Python (core agent library)
- PDF parsing: `PyMuPDF`, `pdfplumber`, `pdf2htmlEX`
- Embedding models: OpenAI embedding API (`text-embedding-3-large`), SentenceTransformers
- Graph database (optional): Neo4j (structured graph storage), or lightweight NetworkX (for in-memory prototype)
- Vector database for embeddings: FAISS, ChromaDB, Pinecone
- Multi-agent loop: Your existing agent-tool-calling library (`cludet`)

## Conclusion

This roadmap outlines a robust, incremental, practical, and elegant architecture for your PDF extraction, embedding, and intelligent RAG system. The clear separation of ingestion (graph + embeddings) and querying (intelligent agent loops) ensures modularity, scalability, and explainability, fully leveraging your flexible agent framework.

Next Steps:  
- Set up the ingestion pipeline (PDF→Markdown→Embeddings/Graph).  
- Define and test agent tools and loops incrementally.  
- Prototype MVP quickly, then refine intelligence and explainability iteratively.
