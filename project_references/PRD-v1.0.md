# Product Requirements Document (PRD): Agent Development & Evaluation Framework (`cck-agents`)


1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the Agent Development & Evaluation Framework called `cck-agents`. `cck-agents` provides a structured, minimal, and extensible Python framework for defining, running, evaluating, and iterating on tool-using Large Language Model (LLM) agents built using the claudette library. The primary goal is to enable systematic experimentation, robust evaluation against baselines, and comprehensive logging for analysis and debugging.

2. Goals

Systematic Development: Provide a standardized way to define agent configurations (model, prompts, tools, parameters).

Robust Evaluation: Enable batch evaluation of agents against defined datasets and metrics. Facilitate comparison between different agent versions and baselines.

Comprehensive Logging: Capture detailed, structured logs (JSONL format) for every agent interaction (evaluation or interactive) to support debugging, analysis, and traceability.

Rapid Iteration: Make it easy to modify agent configurations or evaluation parameters and re-run experiments.

Extensibility: Allow developers to easily add new agent profiles, tools, datasets, and evaluation metrics.

Minimalism: Leverage claudette directly and avoid unnecessary abstraction layers.

3. Target Users

AI Engineers / Developers building and refining LLM agents.

Researchers experimenting with different agent configurations and capabilities.

Teams needing to benchmark agent performance and track improvements over time.

4. Key Features & Requirements

4.1. Agent Definition (AgentProfile)

REQ-AD-001: The system must provide a clear mechanism (e.g., a Python class like AgentProfile) to define an agent's static configuration.

REQ-AD-002: Agent definitions must include:

A unique, versionable identifier (profile_id).

The target claudette model string.

The core system prompt.

A list of associated tool functions (Python callables).

Default LLM call parameters (e.g., temperature, max tokens).

Optional descriptive metadata.

REQ-AD-003: Agent definitions must be easily discoverable and loadable (e.g., stored as individual Python files in a designated profiles/ directory).

REQ-AD-004: The framework must provide a method to instantiate a claudette.Chat object from an AgentProfile.

REQ-AD-005: Tools associated with a profile must be automatically processed (e.g., wrapped with claudette.core.tool if necessary) during Chat instantiation.

4.2. Batch Evaluation (EvalLoop)

REQ-BE-001: The system must provide a component (e.g., EvalLoop class) to run a specific AgentProfile against an iterable dataset.

REQ-BE-002: Each item in the evaluation dataset must be processed independently, using a fresh claudette.Chat instance created from the AgentProfile to ensure isolation.

REQ-BE-003: EvalLoop must support running interactions using claudette.Chat.toolloop or standard claudette.Chat.__call__.

REQ-BE-004: EvalLoop must accept a list of pluggable evaluator functions.

REQ-BE-005: Evaluator functions must receive context about the input item, the state of the Chat instance after the interaction, and optional ground truth data.

REQ-BE-006: Evaluation results from all evaluators must be logged alongside the interaction data.

REQ-BE-007: EvalLoop must generate a unique run name and log all results to a dedicated file associated with that run.

REQ-BE-008: The framework shall allow overriding default agent parameters specifically for an evaluation run.

4.3. Interactive Execution (AgentRunner)

REQ-IE-001: The system must provide a component (e.g., AgentRunner class) to facilitate single-turn or multi-turn interactive sessions with an agent defined by an AgentProfile.

REQ-IE-002: AgentRunner must maintain a persistent claudette.Chat instance for the duration of a session.

REQ-IE-003: AgentRunner must log each turn of the interaction using the standard logging format.

REQ-IE-004: AgentRunner shall provide a mechanism to reset the conversation/session state.

REQ-IE-005: AgentRunner must support interactions using claudette.Chat.toolloop or standard claudette.Chat.__call__.

4.4. Logging (framework/logging.py)

REQ-LG-001: All interactions processed by EvalLoop and AgentRunner must be logged.

REQ-LG-002: Logs must be stored in JSONL format, with one JSON object per interaction/item.

REQ-LG-003: Each log entry must contain, at minimum:

Run identifier (run_name)

Agent profile identifier (profile_id)

Interaction identifier (unique per item/turn)

Timestamp

Run type (eval, interactive)

Input data (prompt, dataset item details)

LLM call parameters used

Final claudette.Chat history for the interaction

Details of any tool calls made during the interaction (name, args, result, error)

Latency (ms)

Final agent output text

Raw final agent response object (or relevant parts)

Token usage information for the interaction

Estimated cost for the interaction (Optional for v1)

Evaluation results (for EvalLoop runs)

Error information (if any)

REQ-LG-004: Logs must be written to a configurable directory (results/ by default), organized by run name.

5. Non-Functional Requirements

NFR-001 (Usability): Defining new AgentProfiles and running evaluations should be straightforward for Python developers familiar with claudette.

NFR-002 (Maintainability): Code should follow standard Python conventions, be well-commented, and have clear separation of concerns.

NFR-003 (Performance): Logging and framework overhead should not significantly impact interaction latency.

6. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for v1)

Web UI for visualizing results and comparing runs.

Integration with experiment tracking platforms (e.g., MLflow, W&B).

More sophisticated analysis tools for log data.

Automated baseline management.

Support for asynchronous evaluators.

Deployment wrappers/integration points.
