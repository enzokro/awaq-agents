## Chat window enhancements - 04/11/2025

I have the following sample and test application written in FastHTML and MonsterUI:

This application:

- Lets users upload files, for now let's focus on PDFs
- - I'm using some simple wrappers around PDF.js to render and manage the PDF.
- Then, the users can "Interact" with a specific file
- - They can ask questions about the file
- There is a sidebar chat window that hooks in to embeddings for the current document.

For now, I'm using a single file's embeddings, and hooking in the chat to these embeddings directly.

Let's focus on one thing:
- Look at the third column of the Grid() layout. This is meant to be the chat interfact, with the messages shown down below. 

We need the following improvements:
- Proper overflow scrolling for the chat_message region, to make sure we can see the full chat history. Right now, things are cutoff at the bottom.
- A better look and layout for the input chat window.
- Minor, targetted, elegant revisions to get this looking like a production grade chat interface.

DO NOT CHANGE ANY CODE! YOU ARE NOW IN PLANNING AND DESIGN MODE!

<task>
Parse the MonsterUI documentation, and find specific sections relevant to enhancing the chat interface. Cite them directly from the MonsterUI llms.txt file in your project knowledge base.

Then, come up with a markdown description of the targetted, requested changes to our chat interface. 
Finally, come up with a mermaid diagram that shows the following:
- Current state of the chat interface
- Target state of the chat interface
- Changes that need to be made to the chat interface to achieve the target state as a graph transformation.
</task>

<guidance>
Read the file many times over. Think carefully and long about the full context of the file, and the relevant sections. Do not worry about time or token limits. Dedicate as many thinking tokens as you need to.
